    "- A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n",

    "- Let's consider a class called \"Car\" that represents the concept of a car. The Car class may have attributes like \"color,\" \"brand,\" and \"model,\" as well as methods like \"start,\" \"accelerate,\" and \"brake.\" An object of the Car class could be created, such as \"myCar,\" with specific data assigned to its attributes. For example, myCar.color = \"red\", myCar.brand = \"Toyota\", and myCar.model = \"Camry\". The myCar object can then utilize the methods defined in the Car class, like myCar.start() or myCar.accelerate()."
