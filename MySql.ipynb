    "#### In SQL, the order of execution of clauses in an SQL query follows a specific sequence. Here is the typical order of execution:\n",

    "7. `DISTINCT`: Removes duplicate rows from the result set if specified.\n",
    "8. `ORDER BY`: Sorts the result set based on specified columns and sort order.\n",
    "9. `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`: Limits the number of rows returned and provides pagination if needed.\n",

The clauses used in a query can vary depending on the specific requirements of the query and the data being retrieved. Additionally, some clauses like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `DISTINCT` are optional and can be omitted if not needed.\n",

Therefore, it's a good practice to verify the specific behavior of the database system you are working with."
