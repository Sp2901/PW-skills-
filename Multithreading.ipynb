    "- Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. \n",

Multithreading allows the programmer to divide application tasks into sub-tasks and simultaneously run them in a program.
