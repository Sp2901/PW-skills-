As the training data increases, an overfit model may continue to perform well on the training set while the validation performance plateaus or deteriorates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visual Inspection**:\n",
    "   - Plot observed vs. predicted values or residuals. If the predictions are too close to the training data points and there's a lot of scatter, it's a sign of overfitting.\n",

    "**Regularization** in machine learning is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting, a common problem where a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and failing to generalize well to unseen data. Regularization methods add a penalty term to the model's objective function, discouraging it from becoming overly complex and helping it generalize better. Here are some common regularization techniques and how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**:\n",
    "   - **How it works**: L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients to the cost function.\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Encourages sparsity by driving some feature weights to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. It simplifies the model and makes it more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**:\n",
    "   - **How it works**: L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's coefficients to the cost function.\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Discourages large weights and encourages all feature weights to be small but non-zero. It's effective when there are many correlated features because it spreads the weight among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Net Regularization**:\n",
    "   - **How it works**: Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 regularization, allowing a model to benefit from both feature selection (like L1) and handling multicollinearity (like L2). It uses a combination of L1 and L2 penalty terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dropout** (for Neural Networks):\n",
    "   - **How it works**: During training, randomly selected neurons are \"dropped out\" or ignored with a specified probability.\n",
    "   - **Effect**: This prevents the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons and helps it generalize better. It acts as a form of stochastic regularization for neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Early Stopping**:\n",
    "   - **How it works**: Training is stopped as soon as the model's performance on a validation dataset starts to degrade.\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Prevents the model from continuing to train and overfit the data. It helps identify the point where further training no longer improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
    "   - **How it works**: Data augmentation techniques create new training examples by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping, cropping) to the existing data.\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Helps the model generalize better by exposing it to a more diverse set of examples without increasing the dataset size.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Weight Regularization in Neural Networks**:\n",
    "   - **How it works**: In addition to dropout, weight regularization techniques like weight decay can be applied to the weights of neural networks.\n",
    "   - **Effect**: It adds a penalty term based on the magnitude of the weights, similar to L2 regularization, discouraging overly large weights."
