    "- The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to 1. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "- If r is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship, meaning that as students spend more time studying, their exam scores tend to be higher.\n",
    "- If r is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship, meaning that as students spend more time studying, their exam scores tend to be lower.\n",
    "- If r is close to 0, it suggests little to no linear relationship, meaning that there is no consistent linear pattern between study time and exam scores.\n",
    "- The result you obtain after calculating r will help you understand the extent to which study time and exam scores are linearly related in your dataset. However, keep in mind that the Pearson correlation coefficient only captures linear relationships. If the relationship is nonlinear,r may not accurately represent the association between the variables. Additionally, correlation does not imply causation, so while a strong correlation may be observed, it doesn't necessarily mean that more study time directly causes higher exam scores. Other factors may be at play."
