    "- Data abstraction is a programming and design tool that displays basic information about a device while hiding its internal functions. Users can look at an interface and determine how a machine works, but they're unable to see how the machine can actually respond to their commands. In other words, they can understand what a machine does, but not how it's doing it.\n",

    "- Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of generalisation: taking a concrete implementation and making it applicable to different, albeit somewhat related, types of data. The classical example of abstraction is C’s qsort function to sort data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The thing about qsort is that it doesn't care about the data it sorts — in fact, it doesn’t know what data it sorts. Rather, its input type is a typeless pointer (void*) which is just C’s way of saying “I don't care about the type of data” (this is also called type erasure). The important point is that the implementation of qsort always stays the same, regardless of data type. The only thing that has to change is the compare function, which differs from data type to data type. qsort therefore expects the user to provide said compare function as a function argument.\n",

    "- Encapsulation: Encapsulation is one of the fundamental OOP concepts. Encapsulation is defined as a method by which data wrapping is done into a single unit. It is used in wrapping up the data and the code acting on the data together as a single unit.\n",

    "- In encapsulation, the variables of a class are hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only by methods of the current class. Therefore, encapsulation is also called data hiding. Encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers like public, private and protected."
